You have 5 questions with 15 seconds per questions for a total of 75 seconds.

The scosre is calculated  by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly  results in a time penalty ( for example , 15 seconds are subtractedd from time remaining).

I had an issue been able to display the 5 questions without adding a copy of one of the questions to the array. Any advice is welcome  and thank you for all the available resources online to be able to complete this homework to a certain point. Still working on making sense of the new terms .
